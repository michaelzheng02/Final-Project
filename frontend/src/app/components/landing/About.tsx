      <h1>Why was GasHub created?</h1>
      <p>
        We're drivers, just like you, and we know how frustrating it is to watch
        gas prices constantly change and feel like you're always paying too
        much. After countless road trips and daily commutes, we realized how
        tough it can be to find affordable gas without wasting time and money,
        so we decided to do something about itâ€”that's how GasHub was born. Built
        from real experiences on the road, GasHub is designed to help drivers
        easily find the best gas prices nearby. Our mission is simple: save you
        money, cut down on fuel waste, and take the stress out of filling up.
        Because at the end of the day, you should spend less time worrying about
        gas prices and more time enjoying the ride.
